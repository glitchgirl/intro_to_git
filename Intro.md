# Who am I?

My name is Morgan, I currently am a fullstack developer at Vedapointe. I work on building data science platforms, and continuing ed platforms. I mostly work in graph databases, which is also something I give talks on. I used to teach the code bootcamp here, and before that I was a developer for multiple retail sites. I graduated from AU (or GRU, or Augusta state, or whatever) with a degree in comp sci, and a cyber security cert. This is my 3rd Hacktoberfest! 

# What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a celebration of all things open source. If you complete 4 eligible pull requests (PRs) you get a free tee shirt! 

# What is open source?

Open source is a type of software where the code is available for free for anyone to see, use, and modify. There are different licenses that tell you what you can do with it. For example, some open source code lets you use it for anything with no attribution, while some open source code is restricted to personal use. 
Open source software is the basis for most of the modern internet. Things like Apache, React, Spring, Linux, and Firefox are all open source. Being able to contribute to open source makes the internet (and other services) better for everyone. Open source software tends to be faster to fixing issues, and can have less security issues (many developers reviewing choices before they get made). 

# What is github?

Github is the website we are on right now! It is the service we will be using to parcipticate in Hacktoberfest! It is an online repository (repos) for us to share and store code. It also has cool stuff like github actions, but thats another talk. 

- Lets make an account

# What is PAT? 

A PAT is a personal access token. This is what github now uses instead of a password. 
- Lets make one.

# What is git?

Git is a version control software that allows you to collaborate, save, and share your work with other people. If you don't have git on your machine, download it. Git is sort of like google docs - you can see history of documents, revert changes, share documents, and access it from multiple computers. 

# Notes before we dive in

CLI vs. GUI
- I will be teaching the CLI way, but this is not the only way. There is github desktop, and a few other tools to use git with (Fork). They are all fine, I just prefer CLI because it's faster, and it's one less tool to learn.
GIT vs. SVN
- svn is another type of version control, that is an older standard. It is still used, but if you have a good understanding of git, svn will be easy to learn.

# Gitting started

- Making a repo (the non-stressful way)
- Adding code
- Pushing code to your repo
- Pulling code to your computer
- Branches
- Pull request
- Conflicts and merging
